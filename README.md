# Car Dealership Application

## Project Summary

This CLI application is designed to be used as an inventory management system for a dealership, allowing salesman to easily search the current vehicle inventory based on desired customer criteria with minimal input.

Inventory is stored in an external file, allowing for widespread usage of the application across the industry. Vehicles can also be added or removed directly from the command line interface, streamlining the inventory management experience.
